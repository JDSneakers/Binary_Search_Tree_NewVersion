# Binary Search Tree New Version
Enhanced Binary Search Tree

## Describe the Artifact
The artifact I chose to demonstrate my abilities with algorithms and data structures is the binary search tree program I created in my CS-260 course in October 2021. It is a program that presents a menu for the user to load auction bids from a CSV file, print them to the screen, allow the user to also search for a specific bid by its id, and remove a specific bid from the data set.
## Justify the Inclusion
The reason I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio was that it best demonstrated my ability to work with C++ and sorting algorithms for sorting through large data sets quickly. I also saw several enhancements I could make to improve the code which would further demonstrate my understanding of algorithms and data structures and my ability to work with them. I made several improvements to the program the biggest being that I added functionality and expanded the binary search to include the ability to search by a given price range along with by a bid id. I removed the hard-coded bid id that only used a specific id to return results for all of the functionality and instead enhanced the code by allowing the user to provide input to allow user-defined requests from the program such as search by bid id, find bid by amount, and remove a bid. I also added a check to make sure that the user choice is a valid input and if not print an error message and prompt the user to try another choice. I added a deconstructor to recursively delete every node in the binary search tree to prevent memory leaks. I also added more thorough comments to better explain what the code is doing for both myself and any future programmers who use the code. I also cleaned up unnecessary comments such as fixme comments and old code that had been commented out.
## Reflect on the Process
What I learned by creating and improving the program were both the difficulties and how important it is for someone to be able to load, sort, display, and find data from large data sets quickly. In doing so I also learned about the security concerns of using C++ over other languages and how to look for these issues and resolve them in the future. Some of the challenges I face in the enhancement of this program were things like dealing with pointers and the extensive attention to detail needed to work with them. I also had to work through the code logically to resolve a bug as when getting close to being finished I had a program that would display the menu but did not do any of the other functions needed to run the program due to an error in one of the key methods that was not a typical bug that would cause the ide to throw errors and thus pointing you in the direction of the problem. I had to work out what part of the code was causing the issue and resolve it based on what part of the code was most likely to cause the issue. Once I worked that out I was able to run the program and all its functionality properly.
## Navigating the App
The binary search tree exe file can be found in the x64/Debug foulder. You will need to have the accompanying eBid_Monthly_Sales_Dec_2016.csv in the same file location as the exe to correctly run the program. The binary search tree program is a CLI program that uses a binary search tree algorithm to search through the provided bid data and allows the user to display bids, find bids by bid id, remove bids by bid id, and find bids by bid amount. First you must enter "1" in the program to load the bids, then you can enter "2" to display the bids or "4" to search by a bid amount range. You can also enter "3" or "5" if you know the bid id to find a bid or remove a bid respectively. "9" exits the program.

## Course Outcomes Met Through the Enhancements of the Binary Search Tree Program
In the binary search tree program I completed all of my planned enhancements for this artifact throughout my coursework, demonstrating my ability to work with algorithms and manage large data sets with industry-standard best practices. I designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices by enhancing the program in two ways, first, which was by adding a deconstructor that prevents memory leaks and adding a secondary binary search tree for filtering by amount bid which further expanded on the overall functionality of the program. This did two things, demonstrated best practices in implementing a deconstructor and demonstrated my ability to program practical solutions that a client would want from the program and implement it into the software. I developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources by enhancing issues in the code that caused the program to break and be vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks by checking the user input and making sure it is an expected input, if not the program will print out an error message and prompt the user to reenter the correct input. I designed, developed, and delivered professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts by communicating proficiently and identifying areas of improvement, and offering suggestions for optimizing the overall code quality and implementing the solutions for them. I employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science by enhancing the in-code comments, making them easily readable, and giving descriptive notes on the parameters being passed to each method. I demonstrated my ability to make supportive decision-making for software design stakeholders by implementing practical use case enhancements to the program with additional functionality such as being able to search by specific bid id and searching by a range of bid amounts. Each of these offers stakeholders valuable functionality that can be adapted to multiple use cases not just in this program but in future development of other software as well.
